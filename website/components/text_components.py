            These days, I like to use to use
            <strong>
                python flask
            </strong>
            when I'm building web apps. For the front end
            I'll usually utilize 
            <strong>
                SASS
            </strong>
            as well as
            <strong>
                GSAP
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
                THREEJS
            </strong>
            libraries. For the database I like to use
            <strong>
                MySQL.
            </strong>
            For deployment, I like to use 
            <strong>
                ubuntu
            </strong>
            on
            <strong>
                nginx.
            </strong>
            Versional control with
            <strong>
                github.
            </strong>
